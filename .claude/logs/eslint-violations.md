# ESLint Violations Auto-Learning Log

This file automatically captures ESLint violations that occur during development and their resolutions. It builds a growing knowledge base of real error patterns from this codebase to prevent future violations.

## Format

Each entry follows this structure:

```markdown
## [Date/Time] - Rule Name

**Problem**: Brief description of what was wrong
**File**: Path to file where violation occurred  
**Code Context**: Actual code that caused the violation
**Fix Applied**: How the violation was resolved
**Prevention**: Pattern to follow in future code generation

---
```

## Historical Violations

*This section will be automatically populated as ESLint violations are encountered and fixed.*

---

## Usage

This log is referenced by CLAUDE.md to help Claude Code generate ESLint-compliant code on the first try by learning from actual mistakes made in this specific codebase.
