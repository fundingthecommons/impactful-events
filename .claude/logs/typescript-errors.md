# TypeScript Errors Auto-Learning Log

This file automatically captures TypeScript compilation errors that occur during development and their resolutions. It builds a growing knowledge base of real type errors from this codebase to prevent future issues.

## Format

Each entry follows this structure:

```markdown
## [Date/Time] - Error Type

**Error**: TypeScript error message
**File**: Path to file where error occurred
**Line**: Line number where error occurred
**Code Context**: Actual code that caused the error
**Fix Applied**: How the error was resolved
**Type Pattern**: Type annotation pattern that should be used

---
```

## Historical Type Errors

*This section will be automatically populated as TypeScript errors are encountered and fixed.*

## Usage

This log is referenced by CLAUDE.md to help Claude Code generate type-safe TypeScript code on the first try by learning from actual type errors made in this specific codebase.
