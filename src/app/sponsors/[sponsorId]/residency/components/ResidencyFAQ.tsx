      <Stack gap="sm">
        <Text>
          The more time that mentors can spend on-site the better. We suggest that you send 
          at least one mentor to be on-site for at least 4-7 days, and we are happy to host 
          more than one mentor from your organization at different times during the residency 
          (non-overlapping dates).

          This onsite presence adds significant value through direct interaction with builders, 
          immediate problem-solving support, and relationship building that enhances the 
          long-term impact of the program.

          The Residency is designed to be lightweight for partners — most of the mentoring 
          and technical guidance can be provided virtually. That said, having some onsite 
          presence adds significant value:

              Beyond the kick-off, ongoing support can be provided remotely (office hours,

          <Text fw={500} span>In short:</Text> We don&apos;t expect one person to carry the whole

          Onsite presence enhances the experience but isn&apos;t required for the full duration. 
          The key is responsiveness and availability when builders need guidance during 
          critical development phases.
