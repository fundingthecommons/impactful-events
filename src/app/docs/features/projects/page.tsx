      </h2>
      <p className="docs-text">
        Projects are pieces of work that participants create during an event.
        Whether you are building software, writing a research paper, or
        developing a new idea, projects give you a place to document your
        progress and share it with the community.

        From the event page, navigate to the Projects section and click
        &ldquo;Create Project&rdquo;. You will be asked to give your project a
