        How Applications Work

      <p className="docs-text">
        When you find an event you would like to attend, click
        &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; to open the application form. Each event has its own
        set of questions, designed by the organisers to learn about you and why
        you would like to participate.

      <h2 id="filling-in-the-form" className="docs-heading-h2">
        Filling in the Form
      </h2>
      <p className="docs-text">
        Simply work through the questions at your own pace. The platform saves
        your answers automatically as you go &ndash; there is no need to worry
        about losing your work if you close the page or lose your internet
        connection.

        Tracking Your Status

      <p className="docs-text">
        You can check the status of your application at any time by visiting the
        event page. The possible statuses are:
      </p>
      <ul className="docs-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Draft</strong> &ndash; You have started the application but not
          yet submitted it.
