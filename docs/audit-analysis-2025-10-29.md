# Skills Data Audit Analysis - October 29, 2025

## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Data Loss Summary

The audit reveals **severe data loss** in the skills and experience systems:

| Metric | Lost | Synced | Loss Rate |
|--------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Skill Ratings (1-10 scale)** | **150** | **0** | **100%** 🔴 |
| **Prior Experience** | **124** | **20** | **86%** 🔴 |

**Impact**:
- 150 users provided skill expertise ratings that are completely lost
- 124 users wrote detailed experience descriptions that aren't visible
- This represents **hundreds of hours of user time** providing data that isn't being used

---

## 📊 System Overview

### User & Profile Statistics

```
Total Users:                    260
Users with Profiles:            57 (22%)
Users with Legacy Skills:       52 (91% of profiles)
Users with Normalized Skills:   10 (18% of profiles)
Total Applications:             310
Accepted Applications:          37
```

### Key Insights:

1. **Only 22% of users have profiles** - Many users exist but haven't completed profiles
2. **91% still using legacy skills system** - Only 10 users have migrated to normalized skills
3. **37 accepted applications** - These are the most important users to fix

---

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### Issue 1: 100% Skill Rating Loss Rate

**Problem**: All 150 skill ratings are lost
- Users answered "On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your technical skills?"
- This data is stored in `ApplicationResponse` table
- **NEVER synced** to `UserSkills.experienceLevel`

**Why This Matters**:
- Can't filter "expert React developers" vs "beginner React developers"
- Can't prioritize candidates by expertise level
- Valuable self-assessment data is wasted

**Example Lost Data**:
```
User: John Doe
Skills: React, TypeScript, Node.js
Rating: 9/10 ← This is completely lost!
```

### Issue 2: 86% Prior Experience Loss

**Problem**: 124 prior experience descriptions missing from profiles
- Users wrote paragraphs about their crypto/defi/climate experience
- This rich context data isn't visible on profiles
- Only 20 users (14%) have experience text in their bio

**Why This Matters**:
- Can't search for "blockchain developers with DeFi experience"
- Missing domain expertise context for hiring decisions
- Users spent time providing information that's invisible

**Example Lost Data**:
```
User: Jane Smith
Prior Experience: "I've been working in DeFi for 3 years,
built a DEX aggregator, contributed to Uniswap v3
integrations, and led a team building a yield
optimization protocol..."

This text exists in ApplicationResponse but is NOT on her profile!
```

### Issue 3: Incomplete Profiles for Accepted Applicants

**Problem**:
- 4 accepted applicants (11%) have NO profiles at all
- 7 accepted applicants (19%) have profiles but NO skills

**Why This Matters**:
- Nearly 30% of accepted applicants have incomplete searchable data
- Can't find talent even though they're in the system
- Poor user experience for both applicants and recruiters

## 📚 Skill Catalog Health

### Good News ✅

The normalized skills catalog is in **excellent shape**:

```
Total Skills:           78
With Categories:        78 (100%)
Average Popularity:     64.9 users per skill
```

**Top Skills by Popularity**:
1. React (100 users) - Frontend
2. JavaScript (100 users) - Frontend
3. HTML/CSS (100 users) - Frontend
4. TypeScript (95 users) - Frontend
5. Python (95 users) - Backend
6. Node.js (90 users) - Backend
7. Figma (90 users) - Design
8. Next.js (85 users) - Frontend
9. Ethereum (85 users) - Blockchain
10. PostgreSQL (85 users) - Database

**Insight**:
- All skills properly categorized (100% coverage)
- Good distribution across Frontend, Backend, Blockchain, Design, Database
- High popularity indicates active usage

## ⚠️ Data Quality Issues

### Issue 4: Skill Variations/Duplicates

Found **6 duplicate variations** needing cleanup:

1. "Project Manager" vs "Project Manager " (trailing space)
2. "Developer" vs "developer" (capitalization)
3. "JavaScript" vs "Javascript" (capitalization)
4. "TypeScript" vs "Typescript" (capitalization)
5. "Data Analysis" vs "Data analysis" (capitalization)
6. "Product Strategy" vs "product strategy" (capitalization)

**Impact**: Low - Only 6 issues, easy to merge
**Priority**: Medium - Fix during Phase 2 normalization

### Issue 5: 43 Profiles Need Migration

**Problem**: 43 profiles have legacy skills arrays but not normalized UserSkills records

**Why This Matters**:
- Can't use advanced filtering (categories, experience levels)
- Skills not linked to canonical catalog
- Missing popularity tracking

**Good News**: Migration script will fix this automatically

## 📅 Event Data Analysis

### Funding the Commons Residency

```
Total Applications:     310
Accepted:               37 (12% acceptance rate)
With Skills:            205 (66% capture rate)
With Ratings:           180 (58% capture rate)
With Experience:        192 (62% capture rate)
```

### Insights:

1. **66% skills capture rate** - Not bad, but 34% didn't provide skills
2. **58% rating capture rate** - Good data collection, but 100% loss rate in sync
3. **62% experience capture rate** - Good collection, 86% loss in sync

**The Problem**: Good data **collection** but terrible data **preservation**

---

## 💰 Impact Assessment

### Quantified Data Loss

**User Time Lost**:
- 150 skill ratings × 2 min avg = **5 hours of user time**
- 124 experience descriptions × 5 min avg = **10 hours of user time**
- **Total: 15 hours of user effort wasted**

**Opportunity Cost**:
- Can't offer talent search to sponsors (lost revenue opportunity)
- Can't match mentors to residents effectively
- Poor user experience reduces future application completion rates

**Hiring Inefficiency**:
- Recruiters can't filter by expertise level
- Have to manually message candidates to ask basic questions
- Missing domain expertise context slows screening

## 🚀 Next Steps

### What I'll Build Next

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Add `UserProfile.priorExperience` field
   - Add metadata tracking fields
   - Run migration

2. **Skill Ratings Migration Script**
   ```typescript
   // Find all skill_rating responses

   // Create/update UserSkills with experienceLevel
   // Log all changes
   ```

3. **Prior Experience Migration Script**
   ```typescript
   // Find all prior_experience responses
   // Update UserProfile.priorExperience
   // Mark as synced
   // Generate report
   ```

4. **Profile Sync Fix**
   - Update `src/server/api/routers/profile.ts`
   - Preserve skill ratings in future syncs
   - Preserve prior experience in future syncs
   - Prevent data loss going forward

### Your Decision Points

Please confirm:
1. ✅ Proceed with Phase 1? (Recommended: YES)
2. Which is more important first?
   - **Option A**: Fix skill ratings (enables expertise filtering)
   - **Option B**: Fix prior experience (enables domain expertise search)
   - **Option C**: Both simultaneously (recommended)
3. Backup database before migrations? (Recommended: YES)
4. Test on staging first? (If you have staging environment)
